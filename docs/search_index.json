For the nMDS and Permanova script you’ll need: install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) install.packages(&quot;ggalt&quot;) install.packages(&quot;vegan&quot;) install.packages(&quot;lubridate&quot;) For the maps with pie-charts the following additional packages are used: install.packages(&quot;sf&quot;) install.packages(&quot;scatterpie&quot;) install.packages(&quot;paletteer&quot;) install.packages(&quot;ggforce&quot;) install.packages(&quot;ggsn&quot;) install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) install.packages(&quot;ggstance&quot;) devtools::install_github(&quot;k-hench/hypoimg&quot;) Also note that at the time of writing, there are still several issues with the transect google sheet: cell U1 states “8” when it should contain a species name (I think “juvenile_dusky_damselfish”) cell BV1 is empty when it should contain a species name (note that currently the label of BU1 runs into BV1, group 1 &amp; 2 added counts - so they should know what species this is…) I am 99% sure that the counts of the “blue hamlet” are actually black hamlets (otherwise add the blue hamlet to the fish list) 1.2 Data structure The scripts expect a folder called “data” within your project folder containing the following files: data/ ├── dive_spots - Sheet1.tsv ├── Fish_list_2020 - Sheet1.tsv ├── Fish_surveys - Sheet1.tsv ├── PAN_adm0.dbf ├── PAN_adm0.prj ├── PAN_adm0.sbn ├── PAN_adm0.sbx ├── PAN_adm0.shp └── PAN_adm0.shx The data sheets (dive spots, fish list &amp; fish survey) were all exported from google sheets as tsv files: The PAN_admn0.* files are only needed for the map to plot the coast line of Panama. They were downloaded from gdam.org. "],

(Technically, the package lubridate is not important, I only used it to propperly format the date column, but the information is never used… ) # loading all needed libraries # ----------------------------------- library(tidyverse) library(ggalt) library(vegan) library(lubridate) 2.2 Custom functions To make the code mode easily understandable (hopefully), we define some helper functions upfront (as opposed to “in the middle of the process”): At some point we will need to fill the empty celly of our data sheet with zeros - by default R will fill empty cells with NA. For this we create a function, that will replace NA in all columns of a data frame except for a specific subset of columns (the “non-fish” columns). # setting up custom functions # ----------------------------------- # funtion to fill empty cells (NA) with zeros replace_all_na &lt;- function(tib, replace = 0, exclude = c(&quot;Date&quot;, &quot;location&quot;, &quot;group&quot;, &quot;habitat_type&quot;, &quot;depth&quot;)){ # get all fish columns (&quot;non-non-fish-columns&quot;) nm_replace &lt;- names(tib)[!(names(tib) %in% exclude)] # create a replacement list in the form of: list(fish_1 = 0, fish_2 = 0, ...) replace_list &lt;- rep(replace,length(nm_replace)) %&gt;% set_names(nm = nm_replace) %&gt;% as.list() # apply replacement list tib %&gt;% replace_na(replace = replace_list) } To make plotting the nMDS results with ggplot a little easier, we create a export function that will take the nMDS results as input and return a list with two data sets (output_name$spots - the transect scores and output_name$species - the species “influence”). # funtion to export nmds results for plotting with ggplot export_nmds &lt;- function(tib, nmds, score_name = &quot;Spot&quot;, species_name = &quot;Species&quot;){ # doublecheck that rownames are uniqe, # otherwise the merge at the end duplicates entries if(any(duplicated(rownames(scores(nmds))))){ stop(paste(&quot;Sorry, the rownames of the distance matrix need to be unique. Currently that is not the case:\\n\\n &quot;, paste(c(&#39;!&#39;,&#39; &#39;)[2 - (duplicated(rownames(scores(nmds))) | duplicated(rownames(scores(nmds)), fromLast = TRUE))], rownames(scores(nmds)), collapse = &#39;\\n &#39;))) } # export obesravtions in nMDS space data_scores &lt;- as.data.frame(scores(nmds)) %&gt;% as_tibble(rownames = score_name) # export species in nMDS space data_species &lt;- as.data.frame(scores(nmds, &quot;species&quot;))%&gt;% as_tibble(rownames = species_name) list(spots = tib %&gt;% left_join(data_scores), species = data_species) } 2.3 Loading data Now, we are all set up and can start with the actual work. First, we need to import the survey data into R. Directly while importing we deal with some issues: we extract the pure site name from the location column (dropping the _mangrove suffix) we proppely format the date (actually transforming the column from character into date-type) since we have several transects per group, we number the transects within each group from the columns Site, habitat_type, group and transet_nr_within_group we create a unique identifier for each transect finally, we use the previously prepared function to replace all empty fish-cells with zeros Beware of the col_types = str_c(c('ccdc',rep('d', 78)),collapse = '') part: here we define the column types (c = character, d = “double”/number). So I the original google sheet changes (eg. by a merge og “blue hamlet” and “black hamlet”) the 78 needs to be updated to the total number of columns - 4! # ---------------------------------- # the actual script # ----------------------------------- # reading in the transect data and replacing NAs with zeros transects &lt;- read_tsv(&#39;data/Fish_surveys - Sheet1.tsv&#39;, col_types = str_c(c(&#39;ccdc&#39;,rep(&#39;d&#39;, 78)),collapse = &#39;&#39;)) %&gt;% # we need unique identifiers for each transect, # so we are going to assign a transet_nr_within_group group_by(location, group) %&gt;% mutate(Site = location %&gt;% str_to_lower() %&gt;% str_remove(&#39;_mangrove&#39;), transet_nr_within_group = row_number(), Date = Date %&gt;% str_replace(pattern = &quot;([0-9]*)/([0-9]*)/([0-9]*)&quot;, replacement = &quot;\\\\3-\\\\1-\\\\2&quot;) %&gt;% as_date(Date), Transect_id = str_c(Site, habitat_type, group, transet_nr_within_group ,sep = &#39;_&#39;)) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% replace_all_na() ## Warning: Missing column names filled in: &#39;X74&#39; [74] After a first check, I realised that we will need to merge the observations within each group (eg. line 2 &amp; 3 or line 4 &amp; 5 of the original google sheet) - here we merge several rows of the data set. We also need to merge the observations over different stages (eg. juvenile_bluehead_wrasse &amp; bluehead_wrasse) - here we merge several columns. To do this merging we are going to apply some tidyverse-magic (using functions from the packages tidyr and dplyr). If you have difficulties following these rather complex steps, it might be helpful to highlight and execute just parts of the code (to see what is going on you will allways need to start with transects %&gt;% and NOT highlight the transects &lt;- bit): # merge by group and fish id transects &lt;- transects %&gt;% # transfrom the data from &quot;wide&quot; into &quot;long&quot; format # note that we select the fish columns here, so the bridled_goby:porkfish # part might need to be updated if the google cheet changes to the # form of fist_fish:last_fish pivot_longer(cols = bridled_goby:porkfish, names_to = &#39;common_name&#39;, values_to = &#39;n&#39;) %&gt;% # create a new column with the fish species (irrespective of stage) mutate(fish_id = common_name %&gt;% str_remove(&quot;_juvenile|juvenile_|initial_&quot;)) %&gt;% # set the logic to summarise over (we want one entry per species # for every site, habitat_type and group) group_by(Site, habitat_type, group, fish_id) %&gt;% # summ the counts according to our grouping summarise(n = sum(n)) %&gt;% # remove the grouping (the effect of this is not visible, # but if we don&#39;t do this the data table might behave strange later on..) ungroup() %&gt;% # reformat back to wide format (note that now the species are sorted alphabetically) pivot_wider(names_from = fish_id, values_from = n) %&gt;% # Since we now have only a single entry per group, # we update our transect identifiers mutate(Transect_id = str_c(Site, habitat_type, group, sep = &#39;_&#39;)) For some reason, some transects are completely empty (0 for all species). These are not informative in terms of community composition and need to be dropped from the data table (otherwise the nMDS will fail because there is no way to compute ecological distances with those transects). To check for this, we create a new column with the sum of all fish for each transect. transects &lt;- transects %&gt;% mutate(total_count = transects %&gt;% rowwise() %&gt;% select(-(Site:group),-Transect_id) %&gt;% rowSums()) Now we filter all transects that have a total count of zero. transects &lt;- transects %&gt;% filter(total_count != 0) 2.4 Run nMDS So far, we have worked with our data in the format of a data.frame, yet the nMDS expects a matrix (this just some internal stuff in R that has to do with the data stucture and you don’t rally have to worry about…). To prepare the nMDS input we select only the fish columns (note that the column order has changed and the fish are now sorted alphabetically) and convert these columns into a matrix. We store the transect ids in the rownames of the matrix (this is no data within the matrix and hence not considdered for the analysis). data_matrix &lt;- transects %&gt;% select(atlantic_spadefish:yellowtail_snapper) %&gt;% as.matrix() rownames(data_matrix) &lt;- transects$Transect_id Now we can run the nMDS on our data and export the results for ggplot. data_nmds &lt;- metaMDS(data_matrix, k = 2, trymax = 999, distance=&#39;bray&#39;) ## Square root transformation ## Wisconsin double standardization ## Run 0 stress 0.2054951 ## Run 1 stress 0.2054983 ## ...

The Permanova is also based on ecological differnces between the transects (just like nMDS), but here we need to compute the ourselves (nMDS does this step internally). # Permanova ------------------ # compute ecological distances between the transects distances &lt;- vegdist(data_matrix, distance = &#39;bray&#39;) # export the hapitat types according to order of the distance matrix distances_groups &lt;- transects[match(labels(distances), transects$Transect_id),]$habitat_type One point we unfortunately could not discuss in class (because of time 😢), is the fact that like many other statistical tests, Permanova also has some assumptions about our data. So, before we start, we need to check if the assumptions for permanova are met by our data (Anderson 2001): “The only assumption of the test is that […] the observations are independent and that they have similar distributions” This means that our data should be homogeneous dispersed - our clusters should be of approximately equal size (similar to equal variances when running an ANOVA or a t-test). The idea here is that if the clusters are of differnt sizes, the permanova might give a significant result because of the size diffence and not because of a difference in location of the clusters on the nMDS. To check for homogeneous dispersion, we can either use a statistical test (permutation test) or visualize the dispersion. # For the test for homogeneous dispersion we nee to compute the # distance of each transect to the center of its respective cluster # (s. https://k-hench.github.io/nmds/nmds.html#9 ) distances_betadispersion &lt;- betadisper(distances, distances_groups) # test homogenous dispersion permutest(distances_betadispersion) ## ## Permutation test for homogeneity of multivariate dispersions ## Permutation: free ## Number of permutations: 999 ## ## Response: Distances ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F N.Perm Pr(&gt;F) ## Groups 1 0.1401 0.140096 4.0667 999 0.051 . ## Residuals 44 1.5158 0.034449 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 Here, we hope for a p-value larger than 0.05, since a value smaller than 0.05 would tell us that the dispersions of our clusters are indeed differnt (that the clusters are of different size). We can also inspect the distances of all transects to the center of their respective cluster visually for the same inforamtion: tibble(distances = distances_betadispersion$distances, habitat_type = distances_betadispersion$group) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = habitat_type, y = distances, fill = habitat_type))+ geom_boxplot() At the stage when I checked the data it looked like our data is very borderline - actually the clusters for mangrove and reef seem to be of different sizes. Fortunately the author of permanova basically told people to chill in such situations as long as their experimantal design was balanced (Anderson and Walsh 2013): “In contrast, PERMANOVA and Pillai’s trace were largely unaffected by heterogeneity for balanced designs” So, lets quickly doublecheck: transects %&gt;% group_by(habitat_type) %&gt;% count() ## # A tibble: 2 x 2 ## # Groups: habitat_type [2] ## habitat_type n ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Mangrove 22 ## 2 Reef 24 To me 22/24 seems reasonably balanced, so we finally run the permanova: data_permanova &lt;- adonis(formula = distances ~ distances_groups, permutations = 999, method = &#39;bray&#39;) print(data_permanova) ## ## Call: ## adonis(formula = distances ~ distances_groups, permutations = 999, method = &quot;bray&quot;) ## ## Permutation: free ## Number of permutations: 999 ## ## Terms added sequentially (first to last) ## ## Df SumsOfSqs MeanSqs F.Model R2 Pr(&gt;F) ## distances_groups 1 3.9133 3.9133 14.904 0.25302 0.001 *** ## Residuals 44 11.5528 0.2626 0.74698 ## Total 45 15.4660 1.00000 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 At this point it is up to you to interpret the results - as far as stats go we’re done.
